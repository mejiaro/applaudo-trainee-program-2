Problem 1
When the program start shows the title just like this:
```
-------------------------
|     Problem 1         |
-------------------------
```

then ask for the number of repetitions and evaluates after the person puts
the the character if is a number if is not then shows a message to the person
that the input is not valid
If is a number then multiply the letter "z" by the number and then shows a message
with all the results

Problem 2

When the program starts shows a menu like this and ask the person to type the number
of option
```
------------------------------------
|              Problem 2           |
------------------------------------
|               Menu               |
| 1.Add number to array            |
| 2.Print the array                |
| 3.Calculate histogram            |
| 4.Clear the array                |
| 5.Exit                           |
------------------------------------
```
Options:

1. Ask the person for a number and then add it to the array
2. Prints the whole array, if the array is empty then print "the array is empty"
3. First check if the array is empty, if is not then proceed to calculate the frequency
of the items in the array and print the result
4. Ask the person if is sure that want to delete the array, if the person type the letter
"s" or "S" then proceed to clear the array
5. Shows the message that is leaving the program


Problem 3

When the program starts shows a menu like this and ask the person to type the number
of option
```
------------------------------------
|              Problem 3           |
------------------------------------
|               Menu               |
------------------------------------
| 1.Add number to array            |
| 2.Print the array                |
| 3.Calculate mean                 |
| 4.Calculate median               |
| 5.Calculate mode                 |
| 6.Calculate mean, mode an median |
| 7.Clear the array                |
| 8.Exit                           |
------------------------------------
```

1. Ask the person for a number and then add it to the array
2. Prints the whole array, if the array is empty then print "the array is empty"
3. First check if the array is empty, if is not then proceed to calculate the mean and
print the result
4. First check if the array is empty, if is not then proceed to calculate the median and
print the result
5. First check if the array is empty, if is not then proceed to calculate the mode and
print the result
6. Invoke the 3 methods (mean, mode and median) and print the result
7. Ask the person if is sure that want to delete the array, if the person type the letter
"s" or "S" then proceed to clear the array
8. Shows the message that is leaving the program
