## Week 2 Evaluation


* Convert all the dates from the given `events.csv` file to EST timezone. 
* If a date is invalid, your script should catch the exception and print out to the console the line number where the invalid date is found. 
* The result of the script should be 2 CSV files, one that includes all the invalid dates, with the line number of the original file, and one with the date and times converted to EST timezone sorted from earliest date to latest.
* Include a graphic in the CSV file that counts the correct and incorrect number of dates.
