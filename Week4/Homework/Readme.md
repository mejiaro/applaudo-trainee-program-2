## Week 4 Evaluation

I divided the parts in different files, for the simulations I created a class `Simulations` where are all the files related to simulations, then is the `fixture_handler` file that is the responsible for all the things related with files, like create the files, the creation of the folder fixtures, the is the `correct_answer` file, this evaluate if the answer is correct or not, this determines whether he wins or loses, the is the `refactoring_homework` this is were all the previous files mention are being called, first evaluates if the argument given next to the `ruby refactoring_homework.rb`
